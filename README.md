# Music FaderNets

**UPDATE 4.11.2020: Updated `arousal_transfer.ipynb` for ease of usage. Added VGMIDI pre-processed dataset in release section.**

This repository contains code for the paper ["Music FaderNets: Controllable Music Generation Based On High-Level Features via Low-Level Feature Modelling"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15474) by Hao Hao Tan and Dorien Herremans.  

Representations of high-level musical qualities are not easy to learn with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. We propose to use low-level features as "bridges" to between the music and the high level features. Hence, the model consists of:

- **Faders**, which control multiple low-level attributes of the music sample independently in a continuous manner. This relies on latent regularization and feature disentanglement.
- **Presets**, which learn the relationship between the levels of the sliding knobs of low-level features, and the selected high-level feature. This relies on Gaussian Mixture VAEs which imposes hierachical dependencies (c → z → X).

## Arousal Style Transfer
You can run `arousal_transfer.ipynb` which uses the GM-VAE model to perform arousal transfer. The steps are documented in the notebook with dependencies and pre-processing stages implemented.

## Train

1. Download the [Piano e-Competition](https://github.com/jason9693/MusicTransformer-tensorflow2.0/blob/master/dataset/scripts/ecomp_piano_downloader.sh) dataset and [VGMIDI](https://github.com/lucasnfe/vgmidi) dataset. `ptb_v2.py` should parse the dataset into desired event tokens while executing the trainer file.
2. For VGMIDI, the pre-processed labels and MIDI token sequences are attached [here](https://github.com/gudgud96/music-fader-nets/releases). Kindly download them and ensure that the pathing within `ptb_v2.py` is correct.
3. Modify the training configurations in `model_config_v2.json`.
4. Run `python <the-trainer-filename>`.
5. The trained model weights can be found in `params/`folder.

Note that to parse MIDI files into event tokens, [this fork of Magenta repo](https://github.com/gudgud96/magenta) is used with several modifications on the [token parser](https://github.com/gudgud96/magenta/tree/master/magenta).

## Evaluate Controllability

To evaluate the controllability of the model (Table 1 in paper), run `python <the-evaluation-filename>`. Some pre-trained models are attached in the `params` folder as examples.
